      <description>A prototype of a self sustained Iot-controlled Hydroponics Farm was developed, using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, which acts as a remote server, hosting a Web application through which the entire farm could be controlled. Through continuous monitoring of sensor values, the &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; functionality of the Farm was achieved. Few of the features of this Farm includes self powered through use of solar tracking panels, panels arranged in the form of a Flower to also allow for rain water harvesting, self induced irrigation through monitoring moisture sensor readings and also adjusting LED grow light intensity according to the crop being grown.</description>

      <description>This is the flagship product of our entrepreneurial venture, Vincere Solutions. This desktop application developed using Python incorporates a set of standardized tests, the results of which are fed as input to a Deep Neural Network Model, to detect the early onset of Intellectual Disability (ID). The app was reviewed in a conference conducted by Victoria Hospital and received certification. Furthermore, talks to implement the app in primary schools as a screening tool for ID are in progress.</description>
