      <title>IoT-enabled Smart Farm</title>
      <link>https://SiddAjriY2Jaccount.github.io/portfolio/smartfarm/</link>

      <guid>https://SiddAjriY2Jaccount.github.io/portfolio/smartfarm/</guid>
      <description>A prototype of a self sustained Iot-controlled Hydroponics Farm was developed, using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, which acts as a remote server, hosting a Web application through which the entire farm could be controlled. Through continuous monitoring of sensor values, the &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; functionality of the Farm was achieved. Few of the features of this Farm includes self powered through use of solar tracking panels, panels arranged in the form of a Flower to also allow for rain water harvesting, self induced irrigation through monitoring moisture sensor readings and also adjusting LED grow light intensity according to the crop being grown.</description>

      <title>KRIDA - Diagnosis of Intellectual Disability</title>
      <link>https://SiddAjriY2Jaccount.github.io/portfolio/krida/</link>

      <guid>https://SiddAjriY2Jaccount.github.io/portfolio/krida/</guid>
      <description>This is the flagship product of our entrepreneurial venture, Vincere Solutions. This desktop application developed using Python incorporates a set of standardized tests, the results of which are fed as input to a Deep Neural Network Model, to detect the early onset of Intellectual Disability (ID). The app was reviewed in a conference conducted by Victoria Hospital and received certification. Furthermore, talks to implement the app in primary schools as a screening tool for ID are in progress.</description>

      <guid>https://SiddAjriY2Jaccount.github.io/about/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Deep Learning, AI and Computer Vision enthusiast and have taken steps towards exploring my interests in these fields by contributing to Research projects in my college. So far, I have indulged myself in Python programming, IoT, Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
Apart from academics, I greatly enjoy any creatively stimulating process, which might explain my love for scriptwriting and storytelling, two of my favourite hobbies. I&amp;rsquo;m a huge sports fan, especially Soccer and Cricket.</description>
