      <description>In what was my first internship experience, I worked at Innointel Global as a Data Science Intern. I was tasked with developing a relevance classification pipeline for the IESM project. Multiple datasets of websites and their summaries were compiled and the website needed to be classified as relevant to a domain mentioned such as &amp;lsquo;Science &amp;amp; Technology&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Manufacturing&amp;rsquo; etc. The pipeline and model developed as part of the internship was directly responsible for pushing deliverables of relevance classification for 42k data points.</description>
