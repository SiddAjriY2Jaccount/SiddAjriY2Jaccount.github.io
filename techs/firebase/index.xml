      <description>This is the flagship product of our entrepreneurial venture, Vincere Solutions. This desktop application developed using Python incorporates a set of standardized tests, the results of which are fed as input to a Deep Neural Network Model, to detect the early onset of Intellectual Disability (ID). The app was reviewed in a conference conducted by Victoria Hospital and received certification. Furthermore, talks to implement the app in primary schools as a screening tool for ID are in progress.</description>
