      <description>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work at one of the biggest IT firms in India today, Wipro Ltd., early in my career. As an intern in the Edge Analytics division, I was first tasked with acclimatising myself to the various cloud and edge infrastructures that I would come across. Post that, I was introduced to Docker and DevOps culture, as my primary task for the next month would be to dockerize Python-based applications that were ready to be deployed.</description>
