      <description>A prototype of a self sustained Iot-controlled Hydroponics Farm was developed, using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, which acts as a remote server, hosting a Web application through which the entire farm could be controlled. Through continuous monitoring of sensor values, the &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; functionality of the Farm was achieved. Few of the features of this Farm includes self powered through use of solar tracking panels, panels arranged in the form of a Flower to also allow for rain water harvesting, self induced irrigation through monitoring moisture sensor readings and also adjusting LED grow light intensity according to the crop being grown.</description>
